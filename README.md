## The Challenge: 

Build a recommender system based off of data from the Jester Dataset, which includes user ratings of over 100 jokes. The dataset includes over a million user ratings. 

## The Goal: 
The goal is to build a recommendation system to suggest jokes to users. We will measure score will be measured based off of how well you predict the top-rated jokes for the users' ratings in our test set.
