### Tyler Watson & Kevin Maga√±a, Dec. 17th, 2017

## The Challenge: 
Build a recommender system based off of data from the Jester Dataset, which includes user ratings of over 100 jokes. The Berkley dataset includes over a million user ratings. 

- Task: Build a recommendation system for jokes
- Data: User ratings ranging from -10 to 10
- Scoring: Mean rating for top 5% of jokes predicted by recommender

## The Goal: 
The goal is to build a recommendation system to suggest jokes to users. We will score the model based off of how well we
predicted the top-rated jokes for the user ratings in our test set. 

## How: 
We implemented item similarity recommenders (using cosine, pearson, and jaccard similarity types) and factorization
recommenders using GraphLab.
